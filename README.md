**Abstract:**   
The experimental and clinical possibilities for studying cardiac arrhythmias
in human ventricular myocardium are very limited. Therefore, the use of
alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. In
this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of
human ventricular cells that, while including a high level of
electrophysiological detail, is computationally cost-effective enough to be
applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of reentrant
arrhythmias. The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the
major ionic currents: the fast sodium, L-type calcium, transient outward,
rapid and slow delayed rectifier, and inward rectifier currents. The model
includes a basic calcium dynamics, allowing for the realistic modeling of
calcium transients, calcium current inactivation, and the contraction
staircase. We are able to reproduce human epicardial, endocardial, and M cell
action potentials and show that differences can be explained by differences in
the transient outward and slow delayed rectifier currents. Our model
reproduces the experimentally observed data on action potential duration
restitution, which is an important characteristic for reentrant arrhythmias.
The conduction velocity restitution of our model is broader than in other
models and agrees better with available data. Finally, we model the dynamics
of spiral wave rotation in a two-dimensional sheet of human ventricular tissue
and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a
period of 265 ms. We conclude that the proposed model reproduces a variety of
electrophysiological behaviors and provides a basis for studies of reentrant
arrhythmias in human ventricular tissue.
